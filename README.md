# Employee Management Application

## Overview

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate competence with React by providing a marketing company with the ability to quickly find information about employees such as the name, job title, phone number, and email address. Along with organizing this information, the user is able to filter the list by names to quickly find an employee.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information, and to organize the information by name or role, as well as filtering the list by name.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
